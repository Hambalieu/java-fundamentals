## Lab 2 Arrays, for loops, testing

### Lab overview 
-This lab is dedicated to creating, interacting with and manipulating arrays in Java.

#### Features
- I use JUnit to write at least one test for each of the Feature Tasks.
- Wrote a method called containsDuplicates that returns true or false depending on whether the array contains duplicate values.
- Wrote a method called roll that accepts an integer n and rolls a six-sided dice n times. The method should return an array containing the values of the rolls.
- Given an array of arrays we can calculate the average value for each array and return the array with the lowest average.
